## Strategy

Throughout the fight:
- Spread out around Altimor to reduce damage taken from [Spreadshot](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334404/spreadshot)
- Avoid other player's red arrow on the ground ([Sinseeker](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=335114/sinseeker))
  - Don't run around if you have this; lock it in and let others avoid it

When _**Margore**_ is active:
- Taunt swap on Margore at as low bleed stacks as possible ([Jagged Claws](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334971/jagged-claws))
- Help soak the red circle that goes on a random player ([Vicious Lunge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334939/vicious-lunge))

When _**Bargast**_ is active (activates from his cage on the western side of the room):
- Move Bargast away from Altimor for [Rip Soul](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334797/rip-soul)
  - Heal the soul to full before it reaches Altimor
- Crowd control the Shades of Bargast for a while and then kill them quickly when stacks get high (20+)

When _**Hecutis**_ is active (activates from the cage towards the eastern side of the northern wall):
- When the raid is healthy, move Hecutis and boss to a new location to drop his stacks of [Crushing Stone](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334860/crushing-stone)
- If you get a brown circle around you, run it out far away from the raid ([Petrifying Howl](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334852/petrifying-howl))

Timewarp
- On the worst add (shorten phase)? or the easiest add (maximum output)?

### Heroic
- Margore's [Vicious Lunge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334939/vicious-lunge) applies [Vicious Wound](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334960/vicious-wound)
- Bargast's Rip Soul adds pulse [Unstable Soul](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339639/unstable-soul)

## Abilities

### Overall
- [Spreadshot](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334404/spreadshot) - large cone attach toward random player
- [Sinseeker](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=335114/sinseeker) - targets several people; avoid arrow if not targeted; focused healing for those hit
- [Huntsman's Bond](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334504/huntsmans-bond) - named pets share damage with boss; CLEAVE AWAY (this does not apply to the pets' spawned adds)

### Margore
- [Jagged Claws](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334971/jagged-claws) - burst damage + damage taken debuff; tank swap mechanic.  Can be removed with bleed removal abilities.
- [Vicious Lunge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334939/vicious-lunge) - split damage in 6 yard circle

### Bargast
- [Rip Soul](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334797/rip-soul) - large tank  damage + add spawn
  - [Devour Soul](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334884/devour-soul) - cast if the soul add reaches the boss; most likely a wipe
- [Shades of Bargast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334757/shades-of-bargast) - spawns two adds; one to the left and one to the right of Bargast
  - [Deathly Roar](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334708/deathly-roar) - interrupt w/ CC, not interrupts
  - [Destabilize](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334695/destabilize) - add gains stacks based on time in CC and number of CCs; stack high to kill easily

### Hecutis
- [Crushing Stone](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334860/crushing-stone) - stacked on every melee hit; removed by moving which does raid-wide damage
- [Petrifying Howl](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334852/petrifying-howl) - 8s dot on random non-tank; 10 yard explosion on expiration; reduces movement speed every second (move out early)
  - [Stone Shards](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334893/stone-shards) - dropped on the ground when [Petrifying Howl](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334852/petrifying-howl) expires
