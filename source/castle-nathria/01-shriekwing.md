## Strategy

Phase I
- Position boss between two pillars
- Tanks taunt swap after every [Exsanguinating Bite](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=328857/exsanguinating-bite)
- Run out of the raid if you get a red arrow on your head ([Echolocation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=342074/echolocation))
  - (maybe; unconfirmed on non-mythic) This will drop [Sangunine Ichor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=340324/sanguine-ichor) puddles
- Dodge the randomly facing frontal cone ([Blind Swipe](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=343005/blind-swipe))
  - Range should out-range this (>12 yards) and not have to move; melee should be spread to minimize number of people who need to side-step
- Line-of-sight the [Earsplitting Shriek](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=330711/earsplitting-shriek) casts using the pillars
  - This will drop [Sangunine Ichor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=340324/sanguine-ichor) puddles

Phase II
- At full energy, boss jumps to middle of the room and wanders around
- Boss takes significantly reduced damage - THIS IS A SURVIVAL PHASE
- Stay away from the boss as she walks around ([Murder Prey](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=345425/murder-prey))
- Dodge the circles that bounce around the room ([Echoing Sonar](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=329362/echoing-sonar))
- Line-of-sight the [Earsplitting Shriek](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=330711/earsplitting-shriek) casts using the pillars (3 times in phase)
