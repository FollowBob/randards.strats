## Strategy

- Tanks swap after every [Overwhelm](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=329774/overwhelm) cast
- Assign 3-5 players (raid size dependent) to each of the two leech debuffs ([Gluttonous Miasma](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=329298/gluttonous-miasma)). 
  - They will stack with each debuffed player to keep them alive
- Players marked with a blue arrow should quickly move to either side of the boss and fan out from each other ([Volatile Ejection](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334266/volatile-ejection))
- Everyone should quickly spread out when the entire raid gets a circle around them ([Expunge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=329742/expunge))
- When the boss starts pulling everyone in, run far away until the channel is over ([Consume](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334522/consume))

### Heroic
- [Obliterating Rift](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=332375/obliterating-rift) - leaves an orb on the ground when [Expunge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=329742/expunge) expires
  - Orbs remain for the fight and do damage to anyone who runs into them. If you need to clear space in the room:
    - have people hit their own orb once they have enough health
    - off-tank clears
    - immunities can be used to clear

## Abilities
- [Growing Hunger](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=332295/growing-hunger) - increased damage to the tank; reset on swaps
- [Overwhelm](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=329774/overwhelm) - big tank hit
- [Gluttonous Miasma](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=329298/gluttonous-miasma) - damage plus prevents healing; permits leech from near allies.  KEY MECHANIC
- [Desolate](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=329455/desolate) - unavoidable, raid-wide damage 20s in and every 1 minute after that
- [Volatile Ejection](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334266/volatile-ejection) - large damage in line from boss to target when it drops
- [Expunge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=329742/expunge) - damage to anyone in the circle when it falls off; hits the entire raid; CIRCLE SIZE IS BIGGER IF THE TARGET HAS LOWER HEALTH
- [Consume](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334522/consume) - vortex toward boss with damage falling off based on distance
