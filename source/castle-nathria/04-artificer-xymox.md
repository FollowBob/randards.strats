## Strategy

Throughout the fight:
- Place one portal in the middle of the room and one near a wall ([Dimensional Tear](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=328437/dimensional-tear)) 
- Tanks (quickly) run their debuff out of raid ([Glyph of Destruction](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=325361/glyph-of-destruction))
- Everyone dodges beams (as well as traps on Heroic)

Phase One ([Crystal of Phantasms](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=327887/crystal-of-phantasms)):
- Fixated players use the portals to avoid the spirits until they despawn

Phase Two ([Root of Extinction](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=329770/root-of-extinction)):
- Assigned players need to move  seeds away from one side of the room using the portals

Phase Three ([Edge of Annihilation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=328880/edge-of-annihilation)):
- Use movement abilities and the portals to stay out of the weapon explosion in the middle of the room

Timewarp
- Phase III (vortex timing?)

### Heroic
- [Stasis Trap](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=326271/stasis-trap) - debuff drops traps when expired. consider using immunities to clear some when out of space
- eight [Seeds of Extinction](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=329090/seed-of-extinction) instead of four (this could be rough with raid size if these are fixed numbers)
