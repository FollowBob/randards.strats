## Strategy

### Throughout the fight:

- Player with brown circle move slightly away from the raid; players with a bleed move into the circle ([Crystalize](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339690/crystalize))
  - Then everyone else moves into the yellow circle to soak the meteor ([Pulverizing Meteor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339728/pulverizing-meteor)).
- Tanks grab the Goliath add and everyone should focus it down.

### Intermissions
- Gather red orbs and bring them to Prince Renethal

### Phase I (General Kaal):

- Tanks swap every [Crystalize](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339690/crystalize) and use it to remove their bleed ([Serrated Tear](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=343881/serrated-tear))
- Healers dispel players with [Heart Rend](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334765/heart-rend) and focus heal them

### Phase II (General Grashaal):

- Tanks taunt swap at as low stacks of [Stone Fist](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=342425/stone-fist) as possible
- Player targeted by [Reverberating Eruption](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=344500/reverberating-eruption) take it out of the raid
  - Each zone left behind needs to be soaked by a player every time this ability is subsequently cast
- Dodge stone spikes on the ground ([Seismic Upheaval](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334500/seismic-upheaval)).

### Phase III (both bosses):

- All of the abilities from phase one and two need to be handled at the same time.
- Try to kill the bosses at the same time.


## Heroic
- Two marked players (red arrows) move off to one side and fan out ([Wicked Blade](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=333387/wicked-blade))
