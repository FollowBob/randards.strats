## Strategy

Throughout the fight:
- Kill Baroness Frieda, then Castellan Niklaus, and then Lord Stavros
- Taunt swap on Stavros and Niklaus at as few stacks as possible (2), while also tanking Stavros slightly away from the raid
- Interrupt every cast of Frieda's [Dreadbolt Volley](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=337110/dreadbolt-volley)
- Quickly kill the add that shields the bosses
- When you get the [Dark Recital](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=331634/dark-recital) debuff, quickly stack with your partner and keep moving
- At 50% health of each boss, get to your indicated dancing spot and copy the movement of the NPC servants ([Danse Macabre](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=328497/danse-macabre))

After Freida dies:
- Bring the servant adds toward the bosses and cleave them down.
- Dodge the dancers that slide around the room in a square pattern ([Waltz of Blood](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=327619/waltz-of-blood)).

After Niklaus dies:
- Dodge Stavros's charge by not standing behind him ([Evasive Lunge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=327503/evasive-lunge)).
- Avoid the explosions from the dancers ([Violent Uproar](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=346303/violent-uproar)).
