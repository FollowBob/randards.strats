## Strategy

Add phase:

- Stay spread out when Assassins or Fiends are active.
- Interrupt the Vile Occultists' [Vulgar Brand](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=333002/vulgar-brand) cast.
- Use slows, stuns, and other crowd-control abilities to slow down the Infusers.
- Heal Kael'thas by healing the Essence Fonts to full, channeling on the Soul Pedestals, and simply healing him directly.
- Get Kael'thas to 45% and 90% health between add waves.

Shade phase:
- Tanks keep the Shade faced away from the raid for [Fiery Strike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=326455/fiery-strike), and taunt swap at as few stacks as possible.
- Stack the phoenixes, slow them, and kill them from range.
- Dodge the randomly facing frontal from the Shade ([Blazing Surge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=329518/blazing-surge)).
- Help soak the red circle on a random player ([Ember Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=325877/ember-blast)).
